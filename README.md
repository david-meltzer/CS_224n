# CS_224n

This repository contains my solutions for the coding assignments of Stanfords Winter 2022 CS224n course on natural language processing. 

- Assignment 1 covered various aspects of word vectors, including the GloVe algorithm.
- Assignment 2 covered the implementation of the word2vec algorithm.
- Assignment 3 used neural networks to perform dependency parsing.
- Assignment 4 covered neural machine translation (NMT) using a recurrent neural net (RNN). 
- In assignment 5 we implemented some aspects of a decoder transformer network and then pretrain and finetune this network to answer questions about where some famous people were born.
