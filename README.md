# CS_224n

This repository contains my solutions for assignment 4 and 5 of Stanfords Winter 2022 CS224n course on natural language processing. The main task in assignment 4 was to perform neural machine translation (NMT) using a recurrent neural net (RNN). The link to assignment 4 can be found <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1224/assignments/a4.pdf">here</a>. The main task in assignment 5 was to implement some aspects of a decoder transformer network and then pretrain and finetune this network to answer questions about where some famous people were born. The link to assignment 5 can be found <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1224/assignments/a5.pdf">here</a>.
